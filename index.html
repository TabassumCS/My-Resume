            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>I do not have formal professional experience yet, but I have worked 
            on several academic projects during my university studies, both 
            individually and as part of a team. These projects allowed me to 
            apply my technical skills in real-world scenarios, collaborate 
            effectively, manage deadlines, and take ownership of tasks from 
            start to finish. I am eager to gain hands-on industry experience, and 
            if given the chance, I will bring strong dedication, a willingness to 
            learn, and a hardworking attitude to any role I take on.
